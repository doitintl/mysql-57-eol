## What is happening?

The MySQL community is planning to [deprecate MySQL 5.7 after October 31, 2023](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/library/lifetime-support-technology-069183.pdf).     
This means that there will be no security patches or bug fixes after this date.

## Amazon RDS
If you haven't already upgraded your instance to MySQL 8, [you will be automatically upgraded by the end of March, 2024](https://repost.aws/articles/ARWm1Gv0vJTIKCblhWhPXjWg/announcement-amazon-rds-for-mysql-5-7-will-reach-end-of-standard-support-on-february-29-2024).

> RDS will upgrade your MySQL 5.7 database to MySQL 8.0 during a scheduled maintenance window 
> between March 1, 2024 00:00:01 UTC and March 31, 2024 00:00:01 UTC. 
> On March 31, 2024 00:00:01 AM UTC, any MySQL 5.7 databases that remain 
> will be automatically upgraded to version 8.0 regardless of instancesâ€™ scheduled maintenance window. 

This goes without saying, but letting AWS automatically upgrading your instances will lead to major problems. 

## Google Cloud SQL
There is no officially announced end of support date, which means that it will be at [least 12 months](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/db-versions#major_version_deprecation_plan) from the date of writing this.
> When Cloud SQL intends to end support for a specific major version, we will send a deprecation notice alerting project owners a minimum of 12 months ahead.    

[According to a GCP community thread](https://www.googlecloudcommunity.com/gc/Databases/Cloud-SQL-MySQL-5-7-EOL/m-p/646209/highlight/true#M1743), end of support will be December, 2024.     
***NOTE:*** This is not an official announcement, but including it here for completeness.    
Upgrading to MySQL 8 also gives you the ability to use [Cloud SQL Editions Enterprise Plus](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/databases/announcing-the-cloud-sql-enterprise-plus-edition-for-mysql-and-postgresql).

## When should we start planning/executing the upgrade?

We ***do not recommend*** waiting for automatic upgrades or deprecation notices.    
***Start planning/executing your upgrade now***
