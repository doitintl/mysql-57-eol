# MySQL 5.7 End of life

Documents to help guide the world through MySQL 5.7 End of life, particularly those on a managed service, such as Amazon RDS and Google Cloud SQL.    
We are not looking to reproduce technical documentation, but rather supplement and aggregate documentation to help create an actionable and successful plan.

### TL;DR

This repo has been deprecated and moved to a new repository. Please see [rdbms-major-version-upgrades](https://github.com/doitintl/rdbms-major-upgrades/tree/main/docs/mysql/5.7_eol/)
